## Pipeline
  * [Execution]

To execute the pipe line the following is required:

-  Install requirements with pip (it is recomended to use a pip-env)
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
-  The following folder structure is expected (it is not created automatically)

```
├── main.py
├── data
│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.
│
```
- Run `python main.py`
- (Optional) For tracking results an mlflow server is expected on http://localhost:5000 by default.
